Some of The Most Important SQL Commands:
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

SELECT Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

SELECT DISTINCT Syntax:
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

SELECT DISTINCT Examples:
The following SQL statement selects only the DISTINCT values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:

Example:
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

Example:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

The SQL WHERE Clause:
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

WHERE Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


ext Fields vs. Numeric Fields:
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

SQL AND ,OR AND not:
The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition
 NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

AND Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;


OR Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;


NOT Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;

What is a NULL Value?
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

IS NULL Syntax:
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;


IS NOT NULL Syntax:
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;


The SQL ORDER BY Keyword:
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

ORDER BY Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;


The SQL INSERT INTO Statement
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.

INSERT INTO Syntax
It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:

1. Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);


2. If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
