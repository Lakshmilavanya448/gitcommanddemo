unit testing _ independent testing 
comes check the main functionality  working are not 
regression testing - to check each every functaionality 

oops through java :
class- blueprint of an object 
 a class concept in java are
     a)Fields
     b)constructor 
     c)methods-collections of statements which returns value upon execution.
     d)blocks 
     e)nested class and interface

object: A entity of state and behaviour  is called object 
 eg:  dog  it contains state and behaviour are 
          state - name ,color, breed 
          behaviour-barking ,fetching, tail

Data encapsulation : Hiding the implementation detalis of the class from the user of the object method is called data encapsulations 
it binds the code and data together and keeps them safe from outside interference.
a)wrapping together of data and information in a single unit 

public interface : software entities interact with each other either in a single copmputer or in a network is known public interface 
it helps the data security .

Inheritance:process of acquiring properties. In  one object inherits the properties of another object.
it allows the reusability  code 

polymorphism:it can perform single action with different  classes.
 eg:           animal (sound()) _ Cat sounds(meow)
                                  dog sounds(bark)
Abstraction :Hiding data and showing thw related dtaa to the final user 

constructor:similar to a method that is invoked when a  object of a class is created 
  a)same name as class name but it as no return type 
constructor has 2 type  there are 
    1)default constructor 
     2)parameterized constructor
Default constructor :
              Default constructor either has no parameter or if it has parameter all  the parameter values are default values .
parameterized constructor :
           Constructor when it acts as a specific number of parameters .
Overloading :More than one constructor with one parameter 
Overridding: Chlid class can give  its own implementation to a method which is already provided  by the parent class  
String: Sequence of characters .it represents by //                      
     EG: "Lavanya"= "l","a",......
String manipulation :Process of handling and analysing  the string.
       Eg:   "lavanya" + "kamani " = lavanya kamani (String concatatination )
Exception handing in Java:
       One of the powerful mechanism to handle the run tym errors.So that the normal flow of the application can be maintained . 
        exception handling can be classified into five types there are
              a) Try- Try is statement which allows define a block of the code to be tested for error while being it is executed.
              b)Catch-Catch is statement which allows define a block of the code to be executed if an errors occurs in try block
              c)throw-used to throw an exception
              d)throws-Declare an exception
              e)Finally- Checking the code in exception handled  or not
